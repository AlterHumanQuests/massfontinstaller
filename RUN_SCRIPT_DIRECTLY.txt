# Font Downloader - Run Script Directly

## Overview
If you're experiencing issues opening the Font Downloader app bundle, you can run the script directly using macOS's built-in AppleScript tools. This bypasses many of the security and permission issues that can occur with app bundles.

## Instructions for Running the Script Directly

### Step 1: Extract the Script from the App Bundle
1. Open Finder
2. Navigate to where you've saved "Font Downloader.app"
3. Right-click (or Control+click) on "Font Downloader.app"
4. Select "Show Package Contents"
5. Navigate to Contents > Resources > Scripts
6. You should see a file named "main.scpt"
7. Copy this file to a convenient location like your Desktop

### Step 2: Open the Script in Script Editor
1. Open Script Editor (found in Applications > Utilities > Script Editor)
2. Choose File > Open from the menu
3. Navigate to where you saved the "main.scpt" file and open it

### Step 3: Run the Script
1. In Script Editor, click the "Run" button (▶️) in the toolbar
2. The script will execute directly within Script Editor without relying on the app bundle
3. You'll see the results in the lower pane of the Script Editor window

## Alternative: Create a New Script File

If you can't extract the script file from the app bundle or it doesn't work, here's how to create a simple font downloader script:

1. Open Script Editor (Applications > Utilities > Script Editor)
2. Create a new document
3. Copy and paste the following simple font downloader script:

```applescript
-- Basic Font Downloader Script
-- This is a simplified version and may not have all features of the original

tell application "Finder"
    -- Create a dialog to get the font URL
    set fontURL to text returned of (display dialog "Enter the URL of the font file to download:" default answer "https://")
    
    -- Ask for a destination folder
    set destFolder to choose folder with prompt "Select where to save the downloaded font:"
    
    -- Extract filename from URL
    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to "/"
    set urlParts to text items of fontURL
    set fileName to last item of urlParts
    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to ""
    
    -- Download the font using curl
    set downloadCommand to "curl -L '" & fontURL & "' -o '" & (POSIX path of destFolder) & fileName & "'"
    
    -- Execute the download
    do shell script downloadCommand
    
    -- Notify user
    display dialog "Font downloaded successfully to:" & return & (POSIX path of destFolder) & fileName buttons {"OK"} default button "OK"
end tell
```

4. Click the "Run" button to test it
5. If you want to save it as a script for future use, go to File > Save
6. Give it a name like "Font Downloader Script"
7. In the File Format dropdown, choose "Script" (.scpt)

## Additional Resources

If you're having trouble with the script:

1. **Check Script Permissions**: Make sure Script Editor has necessary permissions in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy
   
2. **Enable Developer Tools**: In macOS Catalina and later, you may need to enable developer tools:
   ```
   sudo spctl --master-disable
   ```
   (This will temporarily reduce security restrictions; you can re-enable with `sudo spctl --master-enable`)

3. **View Script Output**: In Script Editor, choose View > Show Log to see detailed information about script execution

4. **Check for Script Errors**: If the script fails to run, check the error messages in Script Editor for clues about what's wrong

5. **Alternative Download Method**: If all else fails, you can use the built-in Safari browser to download fonts manually

## Support
If you're unable to run the script even after following these steps, please contact the developer with specific error messages from Script Editor.
